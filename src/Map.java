 * Class Map - a map in the game.

 * This class is part of "The peacemaker" application.
 * "The peacemaker" is a simple, text based adventure game.
 *
 * A "Map" represents a game map. It holds a list of rooms throughout which
 * a player can travel. An object of this class also has instance fields for
 * relevant rooms such as the start room, the finish room, the task room (where the
 * player is given a task in that map) and the teleport room (when a player enters this
 * room, he is taken to another available random room).
