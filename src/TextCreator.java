/**
 * Class TextCreator is used to create pseudo interface in the terminal.
 *
 * This class is part of "The peacemaker" application.
 * "The peacemaker" is a simple, text based adventure game.
 *
 * This class is used to print text to the terminal in various patterns,
 * to create a primitive interface for a better user experience.
 * Use of this class also prevents clutter in the game class.
 *
 * However, this class needs a lot of upgrading, because whenever a new command is added,
 * all the patterns must be changed. In addition, if the text line is long enought, it can go out of bounds
 * in the terminal.
